# C-Converter_to_ASCII
A program that takes any number in any format and converts it to its representation in the ASCII table, in this program we dealt with converting a character into a number by substracting its ASCII value with somedifferent numbers, we handled some possible facable errors and stuff.<br>
In the next program we are going to deal with unicode and try to represent a unicode code point in the terminal if that is even possible &#x1f603; <br>
